This is primarily made for mini midi magic which doesn't even have an end date yet. There hasn't even been the workshop or the big announctment that a lot of people are waiting on to start their project. Mini midi magic didn't even start unil the 2th of september and I think I have te biggest project on it with the most things done. If you just take a look at the journal you can see that I already spent a lot of time on this which isn't even tracked by hackatime. Because all of this I don't have the actual launchpad so I also don't have a demo. After SoM I will spent a lot more time on finishing the firmware and all the features. Then I will submit it to mini midi magic and make the launchpad and a song with it.
